Running nntp//rss as a Windows Service
======================================

To run nntp//rss as a service, we recommend that you use the
enhance JavaService from Multiplan Consultants.

JavaService, a Windows Service wrapper for Java applications, can be 
downloaded from the following URL:

http://www.multiplanconsultants.com/software/javaservice/downloads.html


Installing the nntp//rss service (all supported JVM versions)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have downloaded JavaService, extract JavaService.exe into your 
root nntp//rss directory.

To install nntp//rss as a service, open up a command prompt, change
into the directory where you installed nntp//rss, and issue the following
command, substituting %jvm_location% with the full path to your jvm.dll,
and %nntp_dir% with the directory in which you installed nntp//rss.
 
JavaService.exe -install "nntprss" %jvm_location% 
	"-Djava.class.path=%nntp_dir%\nntprss-start.jar" 
	-start org.methodize.nntprss.Startup -current %nntprss_dir% 

Note that this should be entered as one line in your command window. 

For example, given a jvm.dll location of 
c:\j2sdk1.4.1_02\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll and an nntp//rss location 
of c:\program files\nntprss: 

JavaService -install "nntprss" c:\j2sdk1.4.1_02\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll 
	"-Djava.class.path=c:\program files\nntprss\nntprss-start.jar" 
	-start org.methodize.nntprss.Startup 
	-current "c:\program files\nntprss"
	
If you have installed nntp//rss in a different location, be sure to update
both the "-Djava.class.path=c:\program files\nntprss\nntprss-start.jar" and 
-current "c:\program files\nntprss" parameters to point to the 
correct directory.

As in the above example, if your nntp//rss directory contains a space, e.g.

c:\program files\nntprss

Ensure that both the -Djava.class.path and -current value parameters are 
within quotes.
  
 
Uninstalling the nntp//rss Windows Service
------------------------------------------

Ensure that the nntp//rss service has been shutdown - check this in 
the Services Applet of the Control Panel / Administrative Tools.

Close the Service Applet, then run the following command to 
remove the service configuration:

JavaService -uninstall "nntprss"
