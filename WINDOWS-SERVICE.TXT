Running nntp//rss as a Windows Service
======================================

To run nntp//rss as a service, we recommend that you use JNT.
JNT, a Windows Service wrapper for Java applications, can be 
downloaded from the following URL:

http://www.eworksmart.com/JNT/


NOTE TO JDK 1.4 USERS 
---------------------

Due to a difference in the organization of the 1.4 JRE's directory
structure, you will need to copy a files to ensure compatibility
with the current release of JNT.

Assuming a JRE bin path of:

c:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_01\bin

Create a subdirectory named classic, i.e.

c:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_01\bin\classic

Then copy:

c:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_01\bin\client\jvm.dll

to

c:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_01\bin\classic\jvm.dll



Installing the nntp//rss service (all supported JVM versions)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have downloaded JNT, extract the JNT.exe into your root
nntp//rss directory.


To install nntp//rss as a service, open up a command prompt, change
into the directory where you installed nntp//rss, and issue the following
command:

JNT /InstallAsService:nntprss "/SDc:\program files\nntprss"
  -cp "c:\program files\nntprss\nntprss-start.jar" 
  org.methodize.nntprss.Startup

This example assumes an installation location of:

c:\program files\nntprss

If you have installed nntp//rss in a different location, be sure to update
both the "/SDc:\program files\nntprss" and 
-cp "c:\program files\nntprss\nntprss-start.jar" parameters to point to the 
correct directory.

As in the above examplem, if your nntp//rss directory contains a space, e.g.

c:\program files\nntprss

Ensure that both the /SD and -cp value parameters are within quotes.
  
  
Uninstalling the nntp//rss Windows Service
------------------------------------------

Ensure that the nntp//rss service has been shutdown - check this in 
the Services Applet of the Control Panel / Administrative Tools.

Close the Service Applet, then run the following command to 
remove the service configuration:

JNT /RemoveAsService:nntprss
