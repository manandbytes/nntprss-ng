February 13, 2005 - nntp//rss v0.5-beta-2

+ Introduced Item Processors - this allows custom modules to be plugged
  into the polling engine.  ItemProcessor classes are called when new
  items are received.  An example processor, ItemLogPlugin, logs the 
  channel and item title for every new item to the nntp//rss log file.
  Potential plugins could include alerting and email modules.
+ Set derby.storage.fileSyncTransactionLog=true system property when
  running under Mac OS.
+ Fixed HTTP URL username/password support for those usernames or passwords
  that require URL-encoded characters 
  (e.g. Username: myuser@mysite.com, Password: test,
  URL: http://myuser%40mysite.com:test@some.url.com/feed.xml)
  Thanks to Steven Rohall for his help in finding and resolving this bug!
